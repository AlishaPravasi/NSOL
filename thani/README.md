# National Society of Outdoor Leaders in Equity (NSOLE) App
## For the Daniels Inclusive Excellence Case Competition:
Prompt: Tackle the lack of diverse community/DEIJ initiatives in outdoor spaces.

## Solution:
* By establishing inclusive chapters of NSOLE within schools and universities, we nurture leadership, community, connection, and a lifelong love for nature, ensuring all youth have the opportunity to explore, belong, and thrive in outdoor spaces. 
* Leveraging technology for engagement with NSOLE looks like this app, where one can: 
 ** Share/create events, track attendance, and track progress via leaderboard
 ** Allow students to log reflection and site details via student forums
 ** Jobs feature promotes environment related work for high school/college
 ** Use commenting features to gather feedback and refine programming
 ** Map feature allows students to find local nature spots
 ** Create community between NSOLE members as a whole
* Used ExpoGo to generate a QR code for judges to scan and see our app live during our presentation.
